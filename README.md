## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

A core focus of this project was to deliver an exceptional user experience through high performance. Significant efforts were made to optimize load times and responsiveness, resulting in outstanding Lighthouse scores for the deployed application. Key optimizations include:

* **Self-hosting & Preloading Critical Fonts:** Ensuring fast delivery of essential typography.
* **Image Optimization:** Converting all images to modern WebP format and correctly sizing them to reduce payload.
* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Element Optimization:** Prioritizing the main visual content for rapid rendering.
* **Efficient JavaScript Bundling:** Minimizing and splitting JavaScript to reduce load on the main thread.
* **Addressing Layout Shifts:** Eliminating unexpected content movement for a stable user interface.

**Final Lighthouse Scores (Desktop Simulation):**
